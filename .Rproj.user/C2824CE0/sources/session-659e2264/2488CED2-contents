\eqn{\alpha}-Boruta variable selection
}

\description{
\eqn{\alpha}-Boruta variable selection.
}

\usage{
alfa.boruta(y, x,  a = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), runs = 100 )
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{
The response variable, it can either be a factor (for classification) or a
numeric vector (for regression). Depending on the nature of the response
variable, the function will proceed with the necessary task.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with the compositional data.
}
\item{a}{
A vector with a grid of values of the power transformation, it has to be
between -1 and 1. If zero values are present it has to be greater than 0.
If a=0, the isometric log-ratio transformation is applied.
}
\item{runs}{
Maximal number of importance source runs. You may increase it to
avoid variables being characterised as "Tentative".
}
}

\details{
For each value of \eqn{\alpha}, the compositional data are transformed and then
the Boruta variable selection algorithm is applied.
}

\value{
A list with the results of the Boruta variable selection algortihm for each value of \eqn{\alpha}
as returned by the function "Boruta" of the package \bold{Boruta}. The important elements
are these (all the items returned by the function are of course included):
\item{finalDecision}{
A factor of three values: "Confirmed", "Rejected" or "Tentative"", for each variable,
containing the final result of the variable selection.
}
\item{ImpHistory}{
A data frame of importances of variables gathered in each importance source run.
Beside the importances, it contains maximal, mean and minimal importance of shadow
variables in each run. Rejected attributes get -Inf importance.
Set to NULL if holdHistory was given FALSE.
}
